This Repository contains a Web App along with the model nb that can be used to predict the breed of a dog based on the image uploaded.

## Model
[This Notebook](models/InceptionResNetV2.ipynb) trains the model on Stanford Dogs Dataset.
[This Repo](https://github.com/aka-vm/Hello-CV/tree/master/Stanford%20Dogs) contains the original code, but some modifications are made to make it better.

## Web App
Hosted using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) on [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/).<br>
